# About this project

During the Spring React Week, I developed this application, delving into technologies such as TypeScript, React, Spring Boot, JPA, and Java. The project also involved a cloud deployment via Heroku and used the PostgreSQL database. It was an enriching journey, broadening and solidifying my understanding of web development.
